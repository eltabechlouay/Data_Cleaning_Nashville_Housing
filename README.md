# Data_Cleaning_Nashville_Housing

This project focuses on data cleaning for the Nashville Housing Dataset, ensuring data accuracy and consistency for reliable analysis. Initially, the raw dataset was in an Excel file, which was then imported into SQL for a thorough cleaning process. 

The cleaning involved handling missing values, correcting data types, removing duplicates, and standardizing categorical variables. These steps were meticulously executed using SQL queries to transform the dataset into a well-structured and analyzable form. By refining the dataset, this project aims to enhance its usability for subsequent data analysis and visualization tasks, providing a robust foundation for deriving meaningful insights from Nashville's housing market.
